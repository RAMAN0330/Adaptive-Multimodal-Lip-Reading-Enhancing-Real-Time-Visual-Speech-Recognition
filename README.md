# Adaptive Multimodal Lip Reading: Enhancing Real-Time Visual Speech Recognition in Diverse and Noisy Environments

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an adaptive, multimodal lip reading system aimed at improving real-time visual speech recognition in diverse and noisy environments. By combining visual, auditory, and contextual cues, the system enhances the robustness and scalability of lip reading, addressing key challenges like speaker variability, poor lighting, occlusions, and environmental noise.

### Key Features:
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines lip movements, audio signals, and contextual language models for improved recognition.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Incorporates self-supervised learning to train models on large-scale, unlabeled video data.
- **Robustness**: Utilizes data augmentation techniques to handle occlusions, lighting variations, and camera angles.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Designed for low-latency processing, suitable for real-time applications like assistive technology and human-computer interaction.
